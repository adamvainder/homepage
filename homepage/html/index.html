<div class='basic-text'>You've reached the hompage of Adam Vainder.<br/><br/>As you can see, it is still in its infancy.<br/><br/>
This is an experimental page geared toward learning such full-stack web technologies as NodeJs and Angular, as well as any other technologies and experiments that I care to play around with.<br/><br/>
This page was started on 7/18/2016. As you continue to visit, you will watch as these projects develop.<br/><br/>
Additionally, you can find the source code to all projects at github: https://github.com/adamvainder?tab=repositories</div>
